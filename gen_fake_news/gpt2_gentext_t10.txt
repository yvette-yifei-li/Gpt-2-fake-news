<|startoftext|>A pandemic that infected Japan has crippled the global economy and disrupted the world’s. The World Health Organization has declared the country a global public health crisis. The Chinese government has imposed some of the world’ toughest lockdowns to stop the epidemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cracked by the impact of the pandemic on China and other parts of the developing world, the global economy rebounded in the last year. But the fast-moving vaccines make a crucial difference.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The office housing the Chinese ambassador in Brazil ended up being evacuated from the capital even as its buildings were falling into ruin. The move has raised fears that Beijing is using the coronavirus as a political weapon, and could prompt other capitals to act similarly if the virus becomes more widespread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Covid-19 vaccine has so far prevented the worst of the worst. But it will not stop there. As the infection tally nears eight million, many countries are saying one thing: complete immunization will be impossible before the vaccine arrives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A man in the Philippines has been hospitalized with Covid-19 for more than a month, family members said on Wednesday, let alone the months since. It is the first known case of its outbreak in the West.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When the coronavirus first struck India last year, the country’s factories were almost all built by women’s labor. A top-notch health care system was quickly put into operation. Fights over who would get the best medical care roiled the country for months before the coronavirus pandemic hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An independent committee of experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday afternoon voted to recommend the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older. That endorsement, which now awaits only final approval by Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., is a key signal to hospitals and doctors that they should proceed to inoculate patients.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, clearing the way for millions of highly vulnerable people to begin receiving the vaccine within days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The decision by British drug regulators to recommend against use of the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech in comparison with younger, more infectious variants of the virus also set off a civil war in the scientific community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the pandemic struck, the majority of people who lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus didn’t give up hope. Many still hoped for help and support from their regular paycheck to make it through the winter. But many others, watching the tens of millions of dollars that would be at risk of squandering through the coronavirus pandemic through no fault of their own, quietly worried about their financial futures.<|endoftext|>
