A year ago, when Maryland’s governor brushed aside calls to reopen schools, President Trump declared that schools would be open when he returned the money. Since then, it has become a cautionary tale that the virus in question will likely linger in the air in the coming days, and perhaps for months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the fight against the coronavirus, many educators were at risk of falling ill at the same time. Many were unprepared for the outbreak, and some were even surprised to learn that they were running the risk of contracting the coronavirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on Thursday that schools in the state would be online-only in the fall, after the governor of Texas endorsed a plan to bring students back to classrooms in the fall.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I drove past a mini mall the other day in my hometown, Commack, N.Y., where my favorite Indian buffet, Kiraan Palace, once stood. My brother, Ravi, and I would spend our teenage years as a family at the corner table, closest to the buffet line, while our regular waiter refilled baskets of garlic naan at our table every 20 minutes. While most of our friends were eating at the pizza place up the block or scarfing down hot dogs at Nathan’s across the street, we held court at our unusual hangout because it felt most like home. And when it closed a few years later, we made sure to find a new refuge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After a year of pandemic life, many people need an escape. On Thursday, the Biden administration announced that it would provide $1.9 billion for the nation’s food security needs during the Biden administration, and $350 billion in FY2019 alone.

<|startoftext|>An independent committee of experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday afternoon voted to recommend the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older.

<|startoftext|>The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people around the world. Millions more have lost their jobs, and governments have offered uneven support. In the United States, a reckoning with race and discrimination poured into the streets during the summer, and its effects rippled into the fall.

<|startoftext|>As the pandemic enters its second year, millions of renters are struggling with a loss of income and with the insecurity of not knowing how long they will have a home. Their savings depleted, they are running up credit card debt to make the rent, or accruing months of overdue payments. Families are moving in together, offsetting the cost of housing by finding others to share it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the wholesale market, a company that wants to turn a profit by providing a quality product that people want to wear has long jolted the nation’s capital.

Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has taken his frustration into action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is investigating eight million people who bought loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, the $700 billion centerpiece of the government’s pandemic aid for businesses.

The company’s ad revenue in the United States fell 24 percent to $1.7 billion, and its theatrical business dropped a staggering 98 percent from the same time last year, to $3 million. Total sales fell 12 percent to $6.2 billion, and profit was halved to $478 million.<|endoftext|>

He didn’t stop by the group’s daily meetings often, but he had an idea he was eager to share: He wanted to start a White House talk radio show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For weeks, President Trump has faced relentless criticism for having overseen a slow and ineffective response to the coronavirus pandemic, failing to quickly embrace public health measures that could have prevented the disease from spreading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Trump’s claim that he wielded “total” authority in the pandemic crisis prompted rebellion not just from governors.

<|startoftext|>Democrats opened the most extraordinary presidential nominating convention in recent history on Monday night with a program that spanned the gamut from socialists to Republicans, from the relatives of George Floyd to family members of those killed by the coronavirus, in a two-hour event that was a striking departure from the traditional summer pageant of American democracy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In recent days, the world has watched with curiosity and growing alarm as scientists in the U.K. have described a newly identified variant of the coronavirus that appears to be more contagious than, and genetically distinct from, more established variants. Initial studies of the new variant prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to tighten restrictions over Christmas, and spurred officials in the Netherlands, Germany and other European countries to ban travel from the U.K.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Americans celebrate the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine, many of the doctors and nurses first in line for inoculation say a victory lap is premature. They fear that the optimism stirred by the vaccine will overshadow a crisis that has drawn scant public attention in recent months: the alarming shortage of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., that has led frontline medical workers to ration their use of the disposable gloves, gowns and N95 respirator masks that reduce the spread of infection.<|endoftext|>
