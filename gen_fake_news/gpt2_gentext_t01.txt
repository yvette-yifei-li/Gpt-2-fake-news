While they were shooting thousands of hours of footage for “The Square,” the 2013 documentary directed by Ms. Noujaim and produced by Mr. Amer on the popular uprising in Cairo, they were often in the middle of the action in Tahrir Square, where the military shot protesters and dispersed crowds with tear gas. Some of their footage was confiscated, and Ms. Noujaim was arrested and held for 36 hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There are still folks in every state in America who are convinced that Joseph R. Biden Jr. lost the election in November. Folks still talk about it out of frustration over the length of the race and the impact of the coronavirus on voting in November, and mostly they are wrong. In a sense, Mr. Biden probably won’t face much trouble from here on out. His campaign plane is sitting ducks in mid-February, and his plane is standing ready to take off from La Guardia Airport at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, just in time to haggle with the candidates as they head to Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans are preparing to bypass the Democratic primary system’s robust protections against presidential influence to install Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court before Election Day, a New York Times poll found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the last Friday of June, President Trump met with Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the nominee to the Supreme Court, and others in the Oval Office. It was the last chance to reassure Americans that he would keep his promises to deliver a full-scale trial and ensure that his allies on the court and behind the scenes received equal time to tell voters about the benefits for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Trump kept his promise to deliver a full-scale trial this fall on the benefits for himself and his fellow Republicans, and his own political future, when he suggested he would challenge any outcome unfavorable to him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the coming days, we are rolling out major changes to the virus tracking pages that have been published multiple times a day for the past 13 months. These pages are a popular daily source of information for our readers, so we want to make sure everyone continues to find the information they need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maine announced on Thursday that adults 16 years and older will be eligible for a vaccine on Wednesday, more than a week sooner than the April 19 deadline that President Biden set two weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Covid-19 vaccine will be available for first-dose in the United States beginning on Wednesday, and in Canada and Mexico on Tuesday, a state health official announced on Thursday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Elizabeth Mitchell had just come off back-to-back work shifts in the emergency room at Boston Medical Center last week and was not sure how to think about what she had experienced. In almost three decades as an emergency physician, she, like her colleagues, had never seen anything like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the Trump administration’s top health officials have cited several reasons for concern, including the severity of the pandemic, undercutting care and the lack of specialized equipment that are critical to fighting the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are crucial differences between the two major ways children have become seriously ill from the coronavirus. Both ways lead to the same conclusion: Serious illness from the virus may be more common among certain age groups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With their doors closed, their backs turned inward and their breaths taken, the children have spent the past three weeks locked in their bedrooms, confined to their desks, wearing masks and copying clothes to class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like many parents, Tracey Fine had spent the summer trying to help her children learn at home. But unlike most, she has been talking to teachers and working through lessons in a language she barely understands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fine, the parent of two young children, one of them stricken with the coronavirus, is tired of the pandemic and tired of the fighting. She has rambled on social media about what she has experienced, what she has seen and what she has experienced. But she has not been able to find an audience for her blunt warnings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thousands of students returning to the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York this month are being asked to wear masks in public, register their health status online each day and electronically log classroom visits for contact tracing if a coronavirus outbreak occurs. But the most novel effort at the school to measure and limit virus spread will require little effort and come quite naturally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Trump’s refusal to concede the election has entered a more dangerous phase as he stokes resistance and unrest among his supporters and spreads falsehoods aimed at undermining the integrity of the American voting system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the sweeping emergency response that has characterized the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration has been at pains to make sure that American hospitals and nursing homes are safe, healthy and attractive places to work and where families can gather to stay warm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shortly after taking office, President Trump and his top aides decided to take a politically savvy risk in light of the coronavirus pandemic, turning to experts at the World Health Organization to secure doses of a lifesaving vaccine and inviting top government officials to privately discuss the prospects for getting the vaccine into the arms of the American people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As part of an effort to stop the spread of false information about the coronavirus vaccine, the Trump administration has been pushing to include sex workers in its caseload estimates, a step that could greatly expand the vaccine’s reach into the developing world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The coronavirus vaccine made by the American Foundation for the Research on Autism will undergo rigorous, peer-reviewed statistical validation to ensure its safety and effectiveness, the foundation announced on Wednesday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jodee Burton, a retired preschool teacher who now helps with her husband’s logging business, lives on a remote patch in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a state that has been embroiled in a partisan battle over how to respond to a pandemic that has killed nearly 7,000 people there and almost 200,000 nationwide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twelve days after his wife died of the coronavirus, increasing the enormous toll in the United States by one, Michael Davis, dazed and grieving, went back to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When schools shuttered in March, David Miyashiro, the superintendent of the Cajon Valley Union School District, immediately started connecting with families and teachers. During hundreds of calls, Zoom meetings and socially distanced in-person gatherings, he heard desperate pleas from poor parents torn between work and home instruction, or who needed support for high-needs students.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For months Joseph R. Biden Jr. has condemned President Trump as a failed steward of the nation’s well-being, relentlessly framing the 2020 election as a referendum on the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People in Mississippi who have health conditions that might put them at higher risk of severe illness from the coronavirus are not automatically permitted to vote absentee under the state’s current law, the state Supreme Court ruled on Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Battling record-breaking wildfires during a pandemic was always going to be a challenge, and now some of the worst fears may be coming true: Six members of a fire incident management team in Washington State had to go into temporary isolation this week after a member of a resupply crew tested positive for the coronavirus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On June 30, as the coronavirus was cresting toward its summer peak, Dr. Paul Alexander, a new science adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services, composed a scathing two-page critique of an interview given by an experienced scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Trump said he was giving an additional $13 billion aid package of $1.2 trillion in funding to America’s farmers at a campaign rally in Wisconsin on Thursday night, doling out government resources to key supporters as he looks to solidify his rural base ahead of Election Day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the Trump administration’s top health officials have cited several reasons for optimism, including the country’s low overall rate of new infections, a sign of returning confidence in the country’s ability to militarily confront the virus and a hopeful sign that the pandemic is on the horizon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A week after a violent storm tore through Iowa, toppling trees and leaving grain silos in crumpled heaps, residents of devastated places like Cedar Rapids were left wondering whether the rest of the nation had any sense of their plight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether it’s illicit raves or pool parties, partying on a large scale has returned to many areas of the world, worrying health officials who say the events are contributing to an uptick in coronavirus cases, particularly among young people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A week into the fall semester, the University of Notre Dame announced on Tuesday that it would move to online instruction for at least the next two weeks in an attempt to control a growing coronavirus outbreak, and could move to shut down campus entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most memorable speakers of the first night of the Democratic National Convention was a woman whom many voters had never heard of: Kristin Urquiza, whose father, a supporter of President Trump’s, died of the coronavirus in Phoenix in June, not long after Arizona lifted many of its stay-at-home restrictions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An independent committee of experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday afternoon voted to recommend the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older. That endorsement, which now awaits only final approval by Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., is a key signal to hospitals and doctors that they should proceed to inoculate patients.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people around the world. Millions more have lost their jobs, and governments have offered uneven support. In the United States, the country’s leaders have tried to reassure the country’s weary public by pledging that they would take care of those in need, and President Trump has continued to meet with phalanxes of help from the federal government in ways that advance his long-held goal of universal health insurance coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The coronavirus vaccine made by Moderna is highly protective, according to new data released on Tuesday, setting the stage for its emergency authorization this week by federal regulators and the start of its distribution across the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the time he canceled the show midseason, even President Trump had grown weary of his televised coronavirus briefings.

<|startoftext|>The Trump administration has balked at providing billions of dollars to fund coronavirus testing and shore up federal health agencies as the virus surges across the country, complicating efforts to reach agreement on the next round of pandemic aid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Trump and his top aides decided to shift primary responsibility for the coronavirus response to the states during a critical period of weeks in mid-April, eagerly seizing on overly optimistic predictions that the pandemic was fading so the president could reopen the economy and focus on his re-election, a New York Times investigation found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the past couple of years, Mike Hill poured more than $3.5 million into renovating his Chevron gas station and opening a Starbucks next door.

<|startoftext|>Throughout the season of the pandemic, governors and local leaders have bickered, at times fiercely, over the best way to safeguard the public health.

<|startoftext|>In the scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the Trump administration’s top health officials have cited several reasons for optimism, including the country’s low overall rate of new infections, a sign of returning confidence in the country’s ability to militarily confront the virus and a hopeful sign that the pandemic is on the horizon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The United States economy is headed for a tumultuous autumn, with the threat of closed schools, renewed government lockdowns, empty stadiums and an uncertain amount of federal support for businesses and unemployed workers all clouding hopes for a rapid rebound from recession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three of the nation’s biggest banks revealed Tuesday that they had set aside billions of dollars to cover potential losses on loans, signaling that they don’t expect consumers and corporations to be able to pay their debts in the coming months as the pandemic continues to gut employment and commerce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many retailers across the United States have quietly stopped providing their workers with the pay raises they had dispensed at the start of the pandemic, despite surging virus numbers in many states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at least for now. But as coronavirus cases rise across much of the country, it may become difficult for the companies to keep at it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When California shut down its economy in March, it became a model for painful but aggressive action to counter the new coronavirus.

<|startoftext|>In the coming days, we are rolling out major changes to the virus tracking pages that have been published multiple times a day for the past 13 months. These pages are a popular daily source of information for our readers, so we want to make sure everyone continues to find the information they need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maine announced on Thursday that adults 16 years and older will be eligible for a vaccine on Wednesday, more than a week sooner than the April 19 deadline that President Biden set two weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even as states struggle to contain the resurgent coronavirus, many officials are themselves falling victim to the ravages of the outbreak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Marais of Saint-Cloud, Ill., did not need another test of its grit. Its residents resisted the urge to pull their neighbors out of their homes and into the streets. They pounded the doors of businesses they believed betrayed patriotism, and vowed to keep businesses open despite the risks of more violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, millions of Americans are expected to receive a coronavirus vaccine. But the timing for the shot is not good, as several countries rush to complete their inoculations while the Biden administration remains under attack from Republicans over the timing of the federal response to the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Biden will travel to Iowa this week, he announced on Tuesday, a sign of confidence that suggests his health is improving and his campaign is significantly expanding his vaccination schedule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the latest assault on voting by mail, the Iowa State Legislature adjourned its regular session on Tuesday, a day after Gov. Kim Reynolds of Minnesota postponed an expected vote on whether to allow polling places to remain open during the state’s escalating coronavirus outbreak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When President Biden pledged last week to amass enough vaccine by late May to inoculate every adult in the United States, the pronouncement was greeted as a triumphant acceleration of a vaccination campaign that seemed to be faltering only weeks earlier.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to state laboratories around the country have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the new coronavirus continued to spread unabated within the city of Wuhan, China, government officials last week imposed draconian measures.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With an intense flu season in full swing, hundreds of thousands of coughing and feverish patients have already overwhelmed emergency rooms around the United States. Now, hospitals are bracing for the potential spread of coronavirus that could bring another surge of patients.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For more than a month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been offering to send a team of experts to China to observe its coronavirus outbreak and help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>China is forging ahead in the search for treatments for people sickened by the new coronavirus that has infected more than 28,000 people in a countrywide epidemic, killed more than 10 people and seeded smaller outbreaks in 24 other nations.<

<|startoftext|>When schools shuttered in March, David Miyashiro, the superintendent of the Cajon Valley Union School District, immediately started connecting with families and teachers.

<|startoftext|>Many retailers across the United States have quietly stopped providing their workers with the pay raises they had dispensed at the start of the pandemic, despite surging virus numbers in many states.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the Trump administration’s top health officials have cited several reasons for optimism, including the country’s low overall rate of new infections, a sign of returning confidence that the nation can safely return to a semblance of pre-Covid normality, and the potential for improved protection against a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dr. Elizabeth Mitchell had just come off back-to-back work shifts in the emergency room at Boston Medical Center last week and was not sure how to think about what she had experienced.

<|startoftext|>In the scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the Trump administration’s top health officials have cited a handful of statistics to show the severity of the pandemic. But a closer examination of those numbers reveals a troubling pattern: The health care system is losing ground not just to other countries, but to itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people around the world. Millions more have lost their jobs, and governments have offered uneven support. In the United States, a reckoning with race and discrimination poured into the streets during the summer, and its effects rippled into the fall.

<|startoftext|>A second wave of coronavirus cases is charting a path far from coastal Washington State, California, New York and New Jersey, and threatening population centers in America’s middle. Emerging as a pandemic force in the United States, the spread of the variant has far exceeded the early predictions of many federal health officials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States and daily case counts approach four million, many health experts are looking for ways to ensure that health care workers have access to care as the nation’s health care system emerges from the second wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Health workers are among the first people in the country to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, as the first patients to be fully vaccinated and the first people in the United States to be vaccinated against the variant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, the Trump administration’s top health officials have cited several reasons for optimism, including the country’s low overall rate of new infections, a sign of returning confidence that the nation can safely return to a semblance of pre-Covid normality, and the potential for improved protection against a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans.<|endoftext|>
