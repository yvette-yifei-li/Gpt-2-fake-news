<|startoftext|>In recent weeks, scientists have sounded the alarm about new variants of the coronavirus that carry a handful of tiny mutations, some of which seem to make vaccines less effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ruth Ann Platt, watching the news on television about effective vaccines for the coronavirus, couldn’t wait for them to reach her nursing home in Gainesville, Ga. “I thought it was a great thing from the get-go,” she said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Sheetal Khedkar Rao, 42, an internist in suburban Chicago, can’t pinpoint the exact moment when she decided to hang up her stethoscope for the last time. There were the chaos and confusion of the spring, when a nationwide shortage of N95 masks forced her to examine patients with a surgical mask, the fears she might take the coronavirus home to her family and the exasperating public disregard for mask-wearing and social distancing that was amplified by the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As recently as early June, the vaccine maker Novavax appeared to once again be on the brink of failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As soon as this city began offering Covid vaccines to residents 65 and older, George Jones, whose nonprofit agency runs a medical clinic, noticed something striking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fast-spreading coronavirus variant first observed in Britain has gained a worrisome mutation that could make it harder to control with vaccines, Public Health England reported on Monday. And on Tuesday, a team of scientists reported an experiment suggesting that this mutation might make vaccines somewhat less effective against the variant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly a year into the coronavirus pandemic, as thousands of patients are dying every day in the United States and widespread vaccination is still months away, doctors have precious few drugs to fight the virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For people who have had Covid-19, a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine is enough to provide robust protection from the coronavirus, according to two new studies from Britain that were published late Thursday in The Lancet, a prominent medical journal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine was endorsed on Friday by a panel of experts advising the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the last hurdle before a formal authorization expected on Saturday, according to two people familiar with the agency’s plans. The nation’s first shipments will go out in the days after that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the coronavirus slowly receding, governors around the United States are beginning to relax pandemic restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the start of the year, many Germans were complaining about a shortage of coronavirus vaccines that could free them from onerous lockdowns and limited social lives. Just weeks later, many are now upset that they’re not getting the vaccine they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As concerns grow that new coronavirus variants could blunt the protective effects of vaccines, Pfizer and BioNTech said on Thursday that they planned to test a third booster shot as well as update their original vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hope brought by the arrival of the first vaccines in South America is hardening into outrage as inoculation campaigns have spiraled into scandal, cronyism and corruption, rocking national governments and sapping trust in the political establishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A large nationwide study has found important differences between the two major ways children have become seriously ill from the coronavirus. The findings may help doctors and parents better recognize the disease and understand more about the children who are at risk for either condition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New York State opened two large vaccination sites on Wednesday in Brooklyn and Queens, part of an effort to boost inoculations in neighborhoods that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and where residents include some of those most vulnerable to severe illness from the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The global sharing program designed to make vaccine access more equal delivered its first major shipment of doses on Wednesday to the West African nation of Ghana, ramping up the largest mass immunization campaign in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Afghanistan, whose citizens have largely brushed aside the coronavirus pandemic as exaggerated or an outright hoax, is now preparing to distribute its first batch of vaccines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deaths in Japan fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, a jarring contrast to the huge death tolls suffered by many countries in the pandemic and a signal that Japan’s coronavirus measures have had positive spillover effects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Israeli government has pledged to send thousands of spare coronavirus vaccines to foreign allies, reigniting a debate about Israel’s responsibilities to people closer to home: Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Covid-19 vaccination drive in Lebanon erupted in scandal on Tuesday when 16 lawmakers received shots inside the parliament building, violating regulations aimed at keeping the process fair and transparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On Sunday afternoon, several hundred people gathered in the small town of Codogno, about 35 miles south of Milan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>State lawmakers across the country, most of them Republicans, are moving aggressively to strip the powers of governors, often Democrats, who have taken on extraordinary authority to limit the spread of the coronavirus for nearly a year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the pandemic has been difficult for many in Japan, the pressures have been compounded for women. As in many countries, more women have lost their jobs. In Tokyo, the country’s largest metropolis, about one in five women live alone, and the exhortations to stay home and avoid visiting relatives have exacerbated feelings of isolation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Coronavirus needs to hit public health priorities earlier,” President Biden says, a striking contrast with his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who insisted on scrapping the goalposts after a shaky start. It could also be a harbinger of what could come next, as cases flare up across the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the pandemic forced her children’ school and day care to close, Luwam Beyene started working nights so she could be home during the day. As soon as she gets home, she makes breakfast and gets her son ready for online school. The children often have her attention until she leaves again for work in the evenings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A presidential address in September, when the coronavirus pandemic is at its peak, will likely contain more than a few rainbows and sunshine destinations for the season. But many people are looking for a more compelling reason for the increasingly bleak outlook: Covid-19 is a top priority for many Americans.<|endoftext|>
