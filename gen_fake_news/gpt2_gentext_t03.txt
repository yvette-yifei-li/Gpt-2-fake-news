At the risk of sounding alarm, many students should consider themselves at risk of falling behind if they do not have robust, timely news and steady income.<|endoftext|>

A statewide mask mandate, in place since July, helped further slow the spread of Covid-19. In a state that loves its college football, schools have been able to hold at least some games, making life feel a little more normal to many.

<|startoftext|>President Trump has made clear that he wants a quick agreement with the nation’s governors to begin the nation’s capital back up. But he has also made clear that he has no intention of pursuing that goal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amid the uncertainty swirling around the coronavirus pandemic stands one incontrovertible fact: The highest rate of fatalities is among older people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It probably began with an accident thousands of years ago. According to one legend, rain washed the fat and ash from frequent animal sacrifices into a nearby river, where they formed a lather with a remarkable ability to clean skin and clothes. Perhaps the inspiration had a vegetal origin in the frothy solutions produced by boiling or mashing certain plants. However it happened, the ancient discovery of soap altered human history. Although our ancestors could not have foreseen it, soap would ultimately become one of our most effective defenses against invisible pathogens.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Most of the United States has hunkered down for the past seven weeks, but the spread of the dangerous coronavirus has not stopped.

<|startoftext|>I drove past a mini mall the other evening in my hometown, Commack, N.Y., where my favorite Indian buffet, Kiraan Palace, once stood. My brother, Ravi, and I used to spend almost every Saturday afternoon as teenagers at the corner table, closest to the buffet line, while our regular waiter refilled baskets of garlic naan at our table every 20 minutes. While most of our friends were eating at the pizza place up the block or scarfing down hot dogs at Nathan’s across the street, we held court at our unusual hangout because it felt most like home. And when it closed a few years later, we made sure to find a new refuge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the race to the bottom for the title of worst American president, the same few sorry names appear at the end of almost every list, jockeying for last place. There’s Andrew Johnson, whose abysmal behavior during Reconstruction led to the first presidential impeachment. There’s Warren G. Harding, responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal. There’s hapless, hated Franklin Pierce; doomed, dead-after-32-days William Henry Harrison; and inevitably, James Buchanan, often considered worst of all because of how badly he bungled the lead-up to the Civil War.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There’s a pandemic, an economic recovery that’s losing steam, stalled stimulus talks in Congress and a deeply contentious election that has raised the specter of a constitutional crisis.
